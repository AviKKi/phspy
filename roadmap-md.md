# Product Hunt Crawler Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Basic Crawler
- Functional Python crawler that fetches Product Hunt launches between specified dates
- Command-line interface with date range arguments
- Complete product data (name, URL, description, votes, etc.) exported to JSONL

## Phase 2: AsyncIO Implementation
- Performance-optimized crawler using AsyncIO and aiohttp
- Concurrent fetching of product lists and details
- Significantly improved execution speed vs. Phase 1

## Phase 3: Producer-Consumer Pattern
- Queue-based architecture with producer and consumer tasks
- Improved resource utilization through task coordination
- Enhanced scalability with separate product listing and detail fetching

## Phase 4: Queue Size Limiting
- Memory-optimized crawler with controlled queue growth
- Backpressure handling to prevent resource exhaustion
- Balanced producer-consumer operation with throttling

## Phase 5: Optimized I/O
- Performance-optimized file operations with batched writing
- Reduced disk I/O through efficient buffer management
- Graceful shutdown handling with data integrity protection

## Phase 6: Containerization
- Dockerized application with optimized multi-stage builds
- Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment
- Environment-based configuration and volume support for data persistence
